# odin-recipes
This repository is an assignment of the first project on Foundations course of The Odin Project.

On the project, it is expected to create a recipe pages based on the food that I like. So that on this project I cover two recipes, Nasi Pager and Lentog Tanjung. Both dishes are local foods from my neighbourhood, Kudus Regency, Indonesia.
